## My process

1.  I started with HTML and used some custom tags and semantic markup.
2.  For styling, I used CSS Grid for the card. How do I say Grid was a natural fit for this card layout to me.

- Used the <main> element as the grid container and positioned the .blog-card class as the centered item within that Grid.
- I also discovered later that setting the grid container's height to 100vh (viewport height) makes it horizontally centered.
- I used Flexbox within the .blog-card class to manage the arrangement of its internal elements.

3. I had to figure out different margins, padding and font-size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- @fontface, font-weight,
- CSS Variable
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- box-shadow

### Continued development

- I try experimenting this card style in further challenge.
